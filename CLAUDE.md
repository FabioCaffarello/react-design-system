# Design System

Mono-brand React design system. Single source of UI truth for my projects.
Built by me, maintained mainly through Claude Code prompts.

## Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript 5 (strict)
- Vite (build), Vitest + Testing Library (test), Playwright (e2e)
- TailwindCSS (utility-first, tokens in `src/style.css`)
- Storybook (docs + visual testing), Chromatic (visual regression)
- Plop (scaffolding new components)

## Architecture (3 layers — keep it this simple)

```
src/ui/
  primitives/   # Button, Input, Text, Box, Icon — no composition
  components/   # Card, Modal, Table, Form — composed from primitives
  layouts/      # Stack, Container, Grid — structure only
  tokens/       # colors, spacing, typography, radius, shadow
  hooks/        # shared behavior hooks
```

Do NOT reintroduce atoms/molecules/organisms/templates/patterns. Three layers only.
If unsure where something goes: composed of other UI → `components/`; pure structure → `layouts/`; indivisible → `primitives/`.

## Hard rules (enforced — see .claude/rules/)

- Every component ships with: `.tsx`, `.test.tsx`, `.stories.tsx`, `index.ts`.
- Zero `any`. Props typed explicitly and exported.
- Styling via tokens/Tailwind only. No hardcoded hex/px in components.
- WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard nav, ARIA, focus management.
- Test coverage ≥ 80% per component.

## Commands

```
npm run dev          # vite dev
npm run storybook    # storybook
npm run test         # vitest
npm run lint         # eslint + prettier check
npm run plop         # scaffold component
npm run build        # production build
```

## What NOT to do

- Do not add features for external consumers (token versioning, component registry, migration tooling, Figma sync, MCP). This is mono-brand and solo.
- Do not add dependencies without asking. Especially heavy ones.
- Do not create new top-level scripts. The six above are the full surface.
- Do not write barrel files that re-export everything; keep exports explicit.
